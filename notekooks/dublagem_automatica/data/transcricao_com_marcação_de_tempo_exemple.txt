00:00:0000:00:00 hello my name is andre 00:00:01 and i've been training deep neural 00:00:02 networks for a bit more than a decade 00:00:04 and in this lecture i'd like to show you 00:00:06 what neural network training looks like 00:00:08 under the hood so in particular we are 00:00:10 going to start with a blank jupiter 00:00:12 notebook and by the end of this lecture 00:00:14 we will define and train in neural net 00:00:16 and you'll get to see everything that 00:00:18 goes on under the hood and exactly 00:00:20 sort of how that works on an intuitive 00:00:21 level 00:00:22 now specifically what i would like to do 00:00:24 is i would like to take you through 00:00:26 building of micrograd now micrograd is 00:00:29 this library that i released on github 00:00:30 about two years ago but at the time i 00:00:32 only uploaded the source code and you'd 00:00:34 have to go in by yourself and really
